# obs_avoiding_robot
"self-driving autonomous vehicle" , sounds very interesting right?, here's a simple project on obstacle avoiding robot which is implemented based on Arduino_Uno and senses the environment through ultrasonic sensors. AF-motors,driver shield,servo motor contributes to its functionality.
->run the code using an arduino IDE by installing all the required libraries.
->upload the code to arduino uno board 
->then assemble all the components and connect to the power supply
->that's it your pet is ready.
